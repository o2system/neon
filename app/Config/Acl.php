     * Password Hash Algorithm
     *
     * A password algorithm constant denoting the algorithm to use when hashing the password.
     *
     * The following algorithms are currently supported:
     *
     * PASSWORD_DEFAULT
     * Use the bcrypt algorithm (default as of PHP 5.5.0).
     * Note that this constant is designed to change over time as new and stronger algorithms are added to PHP.
     * For that reason, the length of the result from using this identifier can change over time.
     * Therefore, it is recommended to store the result in a database column that can expand
     * beyond 60 characters (255 characters would be a good choice).
     *
     * PASSWORD_BCRYPT
     * Use the CRYPT_BLOWFISH algorithm to create the hash.
     * This will produce a standard crypt() compatible hash using the "$2y$" identifier.
     * The result will always be a 60 character string, or FALSE on failure.
